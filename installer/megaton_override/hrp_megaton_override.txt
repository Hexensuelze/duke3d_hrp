                   |     Repository Snapshot >= 5.3.566     |
                   ==========================================


WHAT THIS IS ABOUT:
-------------------
This file contains updated data for the Duke3D High-Resolution Pack (HRP). 
It features a modified Polymost HRP for use with the Megaton Polymost renderer
on top of the default Polymer HRP.

Basically, this means: First get the full HRP 5.3 (r5.3.565), the latest update
pack (if available), then this file.

It is possible to run the Megaton HRP without this pack, using the Megaton
command line option -hduke3d_hrp_megaton.def. But this won't work correctly in
conjunction with certain mods, as well as addons like
DukeDC, NWinter, and Vacation.


HOW TO USE IT:
--------------

[ For single player games I highly recommend using the EDuke32 executable and 
  the normal HRP instead of Megaton. ]

Drop the HRP Override Pack into the gameroot folder within your Megaton
installation like the HRP zipfile itself.
Add
  -gduke3d_hrp.zip -gduke3d_megaton_hrp_override-5.3.565.zip
to your command line or use the included batch file to play with the HRP


KNOWN PROBLEMS:
---------------
The Megaton executable (1.3.2 stable) is based on a rather old JFDuke version 
and therefore doesn't support all Polymost HRP features correctly:

 - "animtilerange", "setuptilerange" and "tilefromtexture" are unsupported
 - the maphack system is unsupported  and has  been disabled in this pack
 - frozen models don't work correctly and have been disabled in this pack
 - skyboxes      don't work correctly and have been disabled in this pack
 - pickup models and first person weapon models may (partiallly) disappear at 
   certain viewing angles or sector boundaries.

There is nothing that can be done about these issues other than updating the 
Megaton executable's Polymost renderer code.


IMPORTANT:
----------
This override pack is meant for the HRP v5.3 (=r5.3.565)!


Duke in D.C. HRP (v1.61):
-------------------------
To avoid a messed up level stat screen, make sure that this override pack gets 
loaded after the DC HRP pack or use the included DC-HRP batch file.
