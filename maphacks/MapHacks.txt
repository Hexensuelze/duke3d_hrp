1) ABOUT
========
Maphacks are used to edit the positioning of objects and other parts of a level
in cases where the maps cannot be redistributed. These maphacks' goal is to
improve the compatibility of user created maps with the HRP or the Voxel Pack.
Since there is no central site for map downloads, patching the maps directly
would lead to quite some confusion among players about their respective
versions. By distributing separated maphacks the original map download archives
can be kept unchanged.


2) INSTALLATION
===============
Technically this is like an HRP update pack with maphack additions and 
updates only - therefore, if your current HRP's (or regular HRP update pack's) 
version number is greater than ours, don't use this pack.

Drop this pack into the autoload folder alongside your HRP (5.4 or later) and 
you should be done.

You need a recent EDuke32 executable which has the UserMapHacks functions 
implemented - at least r4886 (source r4884). (HRP 5.4 comes with r5267.)

Currently users are reporting various issues with recent EDuke32 builds. If you 
should encounter problems as well, try the r4495 version with backported 
UserMapHack functions from the "Other Stuff" link below.

Your eduke32.log should contain one or more lines similar to this after playing:
   Loaded map hack file "maphacks/usermaps/foobar.mhk"


3) NOTES
========
The main goal is to get rid of the most annoying HRP-related problems of popular
(highly rated by reviewers) and recently released user maps. 
Since the Introduction of the Poymer renderer in 2009 and the big HRP model 
rotation in early 2012 (r5.1.295), even maps which were designed with the HRP 
in mind need some adjustments. 
Do not expect a maphack quality comparable to what has been done for the 
original game's levels, though. No Polymer lighting for example.

A few older maps make use of tricks which can't be reproduced (yet?) using the 
modern OpenGL renderers. Some recent maps' README files explicitly state that 
the respective map is meant to be played without fancy renderers or the HRP.
Remember that these maphacks do not claim to make those maps look as intended 
if you are using the HRP anyway, but try to fix the obvious glitches as far as 
it is technically possible. Do not complain to mappers, do not ask them to 
'fix' their map if it looks bad when HRPlaying it.

A number of maps and episodes come with custom textures. Tiles014.art, 
tiles15.art, tiles20.art and up, will technically never interfere with the HRP, 
whereas extensive use of custom textures may look off when combined with 
the HRP. In case of conflicting ART I may have added a README and/or a ZIP file 
to explain or improve compatibility. But even if a maphack and further 
compatibility improvements exist, it's still your decision to HRPlay or not.

This Pack is suitable for the Voxel Pack as well, although only the 'angoff'
directive (model rotation) works currently on voxels (EDuke32 r5730). 
But that's the most commonly used correction anyway.


You can help:

 - If you find anything you consider worthy correcting in an already maphacked
level, don't hesitate to report it (DNCOORDS!), and which renderer/HRP version
you are using. Some models (like the 0603 hangbabe) might need different
maphacks and some floor/ceiling aligned sprites may show up different
(or not at all) in either Polymost or Polymer renderer/HRP.

 - You can contribute your own maphacks. Basic information is available at:
     http://wiki.eduke32.com/wiki/Maphack_Language

 - If you have a newer version of an already maphacked level, please let LeoD
   know. (But compare the checksums first.)


4) Support for NightFright's Addon Pack
=======================================
A full set of maphacks is included for each of the following GRPs (208):
  adg.grp       (5)
  aqua_grp      (3)
  bf3.grp       (3)
  bobsp.grp     (5)
  cbp.grp       (8)
  chronic.grp   (5) - Check out HRP-TheChronic-compatibility.zip
  conflict.grp  (3)
  daikarin.grp  (7) - Check out HRP-DaikariN-compatibility.zip
  deadrive.grp  (5)
  dn64rev.grp   (3)
  duke10.grp    (3)
  dukehard.grp (17) - Check out HrpDukePlus-DukeHard-compatibility.zip
  glavic.grp   (10) 
  kaiser.grp    (3)
  losthway.grp  (7)
  math_pak.grp  (5)
  metromay.grp (15)
  milltown.grp  (2)
  mssp3.grp     (8)
  opblitz.grp   (5)
  plugpray.grp  (7)
  red.grp       (7)
  roch.grp      (9)
  showdown.grp (21) - Check out HRP-NuclearShowdown-compatibility.zip ???
  spcmissn.grp  (2)
  taivo.grp    (10)
  tbnw.grp      (5) - Check out HRP-BNW-compatibility.zip
  undertkr.grp  (5)
  vermin.grp   (12)
  wgspace.grp   (8)

Maphacks for the following GRPs are not yet completed (121/194):
  c3po.grp     :  2/4
  escape.grp   :  2/5
  fm3x.grp     : 34/42 - FM1X-FM3X
  forklift.grp :  4/12 - PRETIME Episode
  kucera.grp   :  4/11
  quakis.grp   :  6/8
  space.grp    : 19/33
  urban.grp    : 50/79

Some GRPs' high resloution contents have been left out from the Addon Pack:
  inftime.grp  : 39/39 : Check out IITTC-HRP-compatibility.zip
  moonbase.grp :  9/9
  wgrealms.grp :  6/6
They will probably get recompiled for HRP with the Addon's maps included (54).
They'll become available at the "Other Stuff" link below.

Most other GRPs included in the Addon Pack are probably not compatible with the
HRP, but they need to be actually checked out, though.
